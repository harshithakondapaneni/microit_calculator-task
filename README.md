A simple calculator is a basic application that performs fundamental arithmetic operations such as
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It typically features a user-friendly interface where users
can input numbers and select operations, displaying the results in real-time.
How it works:
The display shows the current input or the result.
Buttons include digits, operators (+, −, ×, ÷), decimal point, clear (C), backspace (←), and equals (=).
You can build an expression and press equals to get the result.
It prevents invalid input like multiple decimals in one number or multiple operators in a row.
Division by zero shows an error message.
